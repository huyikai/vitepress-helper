## Why create this tool

VitePress is a very useful static document building tool. However, after using it for a while, I feel that there is still some room for improvement in terms of user experience.

The default `navigation bar` and `sidebar` configurations of VitePress are quite cumbersome, and the configuration files are separate from the source code files, requiring manual synchronization. This is not a big problem when managing a small amount of content, but it becomes a significant maintenance cost when there is a large amount of content.

On the other hand, as a VitePress user, there may be more than one VitePress project. It is quite troublesome to configure each project separately.

After discovering this issue, I searched for VitePress plugins and found that many people have the same feeling. I tried some plugins, but none of them solved the problem well or addressed the details that everyone is concerned about.

Therefore, I finally decided to write a tool to make it more convenient for myself to use, and also hope to help everyone use VitePress more easily.
